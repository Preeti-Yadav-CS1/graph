BFS Algorithm Complexity
The time complexity of the BFS algorithm is represented in the form of O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(V).

BFS algorithm
A standard BFS implementation puts each vertex of the graph into one of two categories:

Visited
Not Visited
The purpose of the algorithm is to mark each vertex as visited while avoiding cycles.

The algorithm works as follows:

Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices at the back of a queue.
Take the front item of the queue and add it to the visited list.
Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the back of the queue.
Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty.
The graph might have two different disconnected parts so to make sure that we cover every vertex, we can also run the BFS algorithm on every node
